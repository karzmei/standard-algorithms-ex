# Coding some classic algorithms and exercises for practice purposes!

Some classics:
- binary search tree
- a binary min-heap
- graph BFS algorithm
- merge sort

Some exercises:
- Mushroom picker problem (found it on Codility): an 1-dimensional array represents how many mushrooms are found at each spot. Given a starting point and a maximal number of steps, find a walking strategy that will provide you with the maximal amount of mushrooms possible. (Cannot pick twice from the same spot of course.)
- Longest sub-palindrom (found it on LeetCode): find the longest sub-palindrom in a given string.
